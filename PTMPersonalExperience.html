<p>I like planning ahead. I like making schedules, trying to see what i can do in a specific amount of time. The problem is that, i have no determination to actually follow my schedules. Sure, i can make an ideal schedule, complete with the time, place, and goals of a specific task, even back-up plans, in case something important comes up, but, it's just that, it's different when you're actually on that situation. It's as if all the determination you feel were sucked by the planning stage that you have nothing left when you get to the real thing. Not only that but there also are a lot of temptations, distractions from accomplishing said task. This includes games, food, friends, and even laziness. I happen to always fall for these distractions, which leads to procrastination. Every time i let myself fall for these distractions, I waste the time i should be doing my task and end up sacrificing the quality of my work for my own pleasure.
<br><br>
As the years passed by, I have experienced a lot of the repurcussions of my procrastination. I have received low grades, a bad reputation, and disappointment from people around me. These repurcussions made me reflect on my habits for the past years and finally open my eyes about the toxicity of such practices.

<p>Time Management is important for me. It is a very important priority. 
<br><br>First, it gives you more free time. Instead of, let's say playing first, and then doing your requirements, you should do your requirements first. This is because when you play first, you have to stop just to do your reqs and this just gives this feeling of unsatisfaction and incompleteness to you. Because of these feelings, you tend to say "Ok, just 5 minutes more. I just need to do this." Now, this 5 minutes, as you say, gets extended to 10 minutes, then 15, until you forget that you have to do your requirements. So, since you don't want to stop playing once you started, why not do your reqs first si you don't have to stop playing games earlier than what you want, right? In this way, you get to finish earlier with your reqs and have some leisure time.<br><br>

Second, it gives you more time to do the requirement. If you talked to your friends first before doing your requirements, you are wasting your time, time that is allotted to the accomplishment of your requirements. If you waste your time, you also waste the opportunity of your requirement being better because  you get a much more limited amount of time, and sometimes you are even rushing to finish your reqs. By prioritising your leisure, you sacrifice the quality of your work.
<br><br>
Lastly, it also gives you a feeling of satisfaction. Don't you just love it when you finish your requirements on time? It's one of those proud moments you have, especially when you know that you can finally relax after doing the requirement. Not only that but you must have also felt good with yourself when you find out that you submitted on time.

<p>Me? I hate doing things. Especially reqs. But what can I do when deadlines are tomorrow? <strong>Use these deadlines to my advantage!</strong> Basically, I am an Elite Crammer. I do well under pressure (kind of) but the ideas really surge out on crunch time. Its just interesting as how I just wake up from a brain-dead guy to an energetic crammer on the night of the deadline.
<br><br>
But I know this is actually quite risky. There were times that I just can't do stuff, and I fail miserably. Ah, I don't actually really know how to get out of this crazy plan of using the deadlines as motivation on working projects.
